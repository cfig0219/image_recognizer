Your deferment begins   on   07/17/24   and ends on   01/16/25 .\n Any delinquency on your account has been addressed with a separate forbearance. When your repayment resumes, you will not be\n delinquent on the loans.\n However, this forbearance will not remove delinquency information that was previously reported to the consumer reporting agencies.\n What   about   interest?\n Interest   accrues during the deferment period   on   your   unsubsidized   loans.   We encourage   you   to   pay the interest   as it accrues.\n If   the   interest is not   paid as it accrues,   it will be   capitalized   (added   to the   principal   of   the   loan(s)).   If   you   have any   Federal   Family   Education\n Loan   Program   (FFELP)   loans,   capitalization   may   occur as often   as quarterly   during the   deferment   period   and   again   at   the end   of   this period.\n Unpaid   interest on   a   FFELP unsubsidized Stafford   loan   disbursed on   or after   October   7,   1998, will   capitalize   only at   the   end   of the deferment\n period.\n If   you   have any Direct   Student Loan Program   loans, unpaid   interest will   capitalize   only   at the   end of   the   deferment   period.\n What   is   the   impact   of   capitalization?\n The principal balance of   a   loan   increases   when   unpaid interest   is   capitalized.   Interest   then begins to   accrue   on   the new, higher principal\n balance.   As   a   result,   more   interest   may   accrue   over the   life   of the   loan, the   monthly   payment amount   may   be higher, and   more   payments   may\n be   required.\n To   assist   you,   we've   enclosed   a   document   that provides   examples that   show   how   capitalization   of interest   can   impact   loan principal   and the\n total   interest paid over the   life of   a   loan.   You   can   also   monitor   and pay the   accrued   interest   online by   creating   or   logging   into   your   account at\n Aidvantage.studentaid.gov.\n May payments be made before the end of the deferment?\n You may make payments during the deferment or request that it be shortened or cancelled at any time by calling us or by writing to us at the\n above address.\n Your payment   schedule   will   be   sent   to   you   shortly   before   you're   required   to begin   repaying   your   loans.   In the   meantime,   if   anything   changes\n that   could   affect   your   status,   please   let   us   know.\n We’re here to help\n\nIf you have any questions about your account or your options, visit us online at   Aidvantage.studentaid.gov   or give us a call at 800-722-\n 1300. Our hours of operation can be found online at   Aidvantage.studentaid.gov/contact-us .\n Important disclosure(s)\n Auto Pay suspension during forbearance/deferment\n If you are receiving an interest rate reduction for using Auto Pay, the rate reduction will be suspended during your forbearance or\n deferment.\n Capitalization of interest\n Unpaid interest may be capitalized (added to your Unpaid Principal) at the expiration of a deferment. This applies to Direct Loan(s) not\n eligible for interest subsidies during period(s) of deferment. Capitalization increases both the principal balance and total loan cost.\n Servicing of federal student loans\n Your federal student loans referenced in this letter are owned by the U.S. Department of Education. The terms of the federal student loan\n programs are not determined by Aidvantage, they are established by federal law, in particular by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as\n amended, and U.S. Department of Education regulations. Among other things, the law and regulations set borrowing limits, interest rates,\n eligibility for subsidies, repayment plans, capitalization of interest, and loan forgiveness. As your loan servicer, Aidvantage is required to\n administer your loans on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education in accordance with the law.\n Your loan servicer\n Your loans are serviced by Aidvantage (NMLS# 2241381).\n Avoiding scams\n You   never   have to pay a fee for help with your federal student aid.

This\n example shows interest calculations for a loan with:\n \u0000   A $30,000 balance\n \u0000   A 6% interest rate\n \u0000   $0 accrued interest before the period of deferment\n In this example, paying the interest only during a period of deferment, when interest is capitalized quarterly and at the end of the deferment,\n lowers the monthly payment by about   $21 a month.   That’s about   $714   over the life of the loan.\n This is just an example. The actual impact on your loans, including the capitalization of interest, may vary based on things such as:\n \u0000   The loan program\n \u0000   Interest rate\n \u0000   Amount owed at the time you enter deferment\n \u0000   Length of your deferment\n \u0000   Repayment period\n \u0000   Frequency of capitalization\n \u0000   Future repayment pattern\n \u0000   Whether the federal government pays the interest accruing during deferment\n Interest paid during\n deferment\n Interest capitalized\n at the end of\n deferment\n Interest capitalized\n quarterly during deferment\n and at the end\n\nLoan amount   $30,000   $30,000   $30,000\n Capitalized interest for\n 12 months  \n$0   $1,800.00   $1,841\n Principal balance to be\n repaid  \n$30,000   $31,800   $31,841\n Monthly payment   $333   $353   $354\n Number of payments   120   120   120\n Total amount repaid   $41,766*   $42,360   $42,480\n Total interest paid   $11,766   $12,360   $12,480\n *Total amount repaid includes interest paid during the 12-month period of deferment.\n Important disclosure(s)\n Servicing of federal student loans\n Your federal student loans referenced in this letter are owned by the U.S. Department of Education.
